# FakeServerBan
Kick players with the ban message from popular servers!

This plugin simply opens a GUI that allows you to kick the player you entered from the server following the format of a hacking ban from popular servers.

Currently, supported servers are Hypixel, Mineplex, Cubecraft, GommeHD,
CosmicPrison, Skycade, VeltPvP, InvadedLands, MunchyMC, and a custom message.

Command(s):
/fakeserverban <player>
Aliases - /fsb
Permission - fsb.use (If a player attempts a command and does not have permission it will log to console)
Usage - Opens the GUI and allows you to select a server to kick the player.

/fakeserverban reload
Aliases - /fsb
Permission - fsb.reload (If a player attempts a command and does not have permission it will log to console)
Usage - Reloads the plugin.

Coming Soon:

- I plan on changing the items in the GUI to skulls with a logo of the server soontm.
- Better resource formatting.
- Your suggestion here?



If you want a server added or have any other suggestions please tell me on the discussion page, Thanks! :unsure:
